# Computational Intelligence for the Internet of Things

This project develops a Neural Network (NN) model to estimate Sensor Localization Error (ESLE) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), essential for effective IoT applications. Utilizing a dataset of 285 records, which includes parameters like node density and transmission range, the model aims to predict localization error without relying on costly GPS systems. The dataset requires careful preprocessing to address noise and outliers. The project involves training the NN while avoiding overfitting through a proper Train/Validation/Test split. Deliverables include the trained model, a testing script for unseen data, and a report detailing the methodology and results. This work contributes to enhancing localization accuracy in WSNs, facilitating improved IoT solutions.
